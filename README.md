Scavenger Hunt

This project will be a scavenger hunt where a user will navigate through different folders and files.
We will be using .txt files that have landmarks in ASCII art with clues to the next landmark.
Users will have to look through the file system to navigate the scavenger hunt.

When you get to the end you will get a prize!!
